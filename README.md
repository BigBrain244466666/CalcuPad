# CalcuPad

CalcuPad is a 10 key macropad that includes all the digits 0-9.

It's very basic as it is my first build, but I guess you could say it has all the digits you ever need.

# CAD

This macropad has two 3D printed layers, a top and a bottom, it is a very simple design, with some LED lights and 10 keys.
